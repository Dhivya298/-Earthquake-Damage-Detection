# -Earthquake-Damage-Detection
The project predicts building damage severity during earthquakes using a dataset of structural attributes and geographic features. Advanced machine learning models were utilized to classify damage levels and assist in disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies. This analysis helps stakeholders prioritize resource allocation and improve safety measures.
